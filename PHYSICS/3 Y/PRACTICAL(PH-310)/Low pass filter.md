#### what is alpha??

#### why cut off frequency 70.7%??

#### attenuation cases

#### pass band vs stop band


#### inductance vs impedance for low pass filter

#### how circuit works in low pass circuit analysis

#### Active filters vs passive filters

#### DOUBLE-TUNED FILTER

#### BODE PLOTS
The curves obtained for the magnitude and/or phase angle versus frequency are called Bode plots (Fig. 23.44). Through the use of straight-line segments called idealized Bode plots, the frequency response of a system can be found efficiently and accurately.


#### L-C low pass filter??

#### LOW-PASS FILTER WITH LIMITED ATTENUATION
