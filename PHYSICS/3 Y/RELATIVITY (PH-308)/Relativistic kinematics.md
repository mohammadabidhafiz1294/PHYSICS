### Special Theory of Relativity 
 In physics, the **special theory of relativity**, or **special relativity** for short, is a scientific theory of the relationship between [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime").

   ### **Postulates of special relativity**

 1. First postulate (**principle of relativity**)

    The laws of physics take the same form in all [inertial frames of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frames_of_reference "Inertial frames of reference").

 2. Second postulate (**invariance of c**)
     As measured in any inertial frame of reference, light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity _c_ that is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. Or: the speed of light in free space has the same value _c_ in all inertial frames of reference.
