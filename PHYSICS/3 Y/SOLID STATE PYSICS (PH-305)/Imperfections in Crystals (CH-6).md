### Vacant site vs Interstitial site 
 Vacancies, interstitials, and substitutions are three of them. **A vacancy is where an atom is missing from its lattice site**. The number of vacancies in a metal crystal increases as the temperature increases. An interstitial is an atom that occupies the space between the atoms on the lattice sites.

### Schottky defect vs Frenkel Defect

 **Schottky defect** occurs when oppositely charged atoms (cation and anion) leave their corresponding lattice sites and create a pair of Vacancy Defects. Since both cation and anion leave the lattice sites at the same time, so overall electrical neutrality of the crystal is maintained; however, density reduces because of the vacancies. Schottky defects occur in ionic crystals where the size of anion is almost same with the size of the cation.

 **Frenkel Defect** is one type of point defect where an atom (better to say ion, especially cation) leaves its original lattice site and occupies an interstitial position on the same crystal. Usually, this type of defect is observed in ionic solids, where size of anion is substantially larger than the size of cation.

## #Atom vs #molecule vs #valency

Molecule, atom, and valency are terms used in chemistry to describe different aspects of chemical structures and bonding:

1. *Atom*: An atom is the basic unit of matter and the smallest indivisible particle of an element. Each element is composed of atoms, and each atom consists of a nucleus (containing protons and neutrons) surrounded by electrons in energy levels or shells. Atoms can combine with other atoms through chemical bonding to form molecules and compounds.
    
2. *Molecule*: A molecule is a group of two or more atoms chemically bonded together. It can be composed of atoms of the same element or different elements. Molecules can be simple, like diatomic molecules (e.g., O2, N2), or complex, like water (H2O) or glucose (C6H12O6). The atoms in a molecule are held together by chemical bonds, which can be covalent, ionic, or metallic, depending on the nature of the bonding electrons.
    
3. *Valency* (Valence): Valency, also known as valence, is a measure of the combining capacity of an atom to form chemical bonds with other atoms. It represents the number of electrons an atom can gain, lose, or share to achieve a stable electronic configuration. The valency of an atom is related to the number of valence electrons, which are the electrons found in the outermost energy level or shell of the atom.
    

**For example:**

- In the case of hydrogen (H), it has one valence electron and can form one chemical bond by sharing its electron with another atom to create H2 (hydrogen molecule).
- Oxygen (O) has six valence electrons and can form two chemical bonds, leading to the formation of diatomic oxygen (O2) molecules.

> Understanding the concept of valency helps predict the types and numbers of chemical bonds that atoms can form when they combine to create molecules or compounds. The valency of elements is an essential factor in understanding chemical reactions and the formation of different chemical substances.
